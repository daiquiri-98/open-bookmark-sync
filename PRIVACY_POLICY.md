# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-09-28_

Open Bookmark Sync collects **no personal data**. The browser extension operates entirely within your browser and only interacts with the Raindrop.io API using credentials that you explicitly provide. We do not run any analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising, and we do not log or transmit your browsing activity to our servers.

## Data access
- OAuth tokens are stored locally in your browser's storage so the extension can communicate with Raindrop.io on your behalf.
- Tokens exchanged through the optional Cloudflare Worker proxy are kept in an in-memory key-value store for a short, single-use period (typically 2 minutes) only to complete the login flow.
- We never store bookmarks, collections, or any other content from your Raindrop.io account on our infrastructure.

## Third-party services
We rely on the Raindrop.io API to perform bookmark synchronization that you initiate. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainers at privacy@openbookmark.app.
